# To Do:

## Job Allocation (to be done by Tuesday Evening):

### Edward
- populate database
- triggers

#### Triggers
- If the current time is 4 hours or more after the start time of ride, the driver can rate the riders and the riders can rate the driver
- seats_available for a ride post must be at most seats_total - 1

#### Other
- Implement transactions for database updates (Ex. placing bids, creating listings, updating profile, creating new users)
- Consider replacing 'owner' with 'car' in posts, because we can obtain a user from a car but not vice versa


### Hung
- bid index: populating the bids for a certain user; button for cancelling bid
- ad edit: has to land in ad profile


### Ming Wei
- bid profile


### Cherry
- ad profile: diff pages for owner, passenger, admin; list of bids
- user edit: ability to update phone number and email

### Dora
- modify ER diagram to reflect changes made to database schema


## Pages to Fix
- bid index
- bid profile
- user edit
- ads edit (polish)
- ad edit #kicks you out to wrong page
